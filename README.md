# graph-problems
This is a repository to research and learn interesting graph problems and algorithms.

## Introduction
Graph problems and algorithms are very fundermental yet critical applicable to many real world problems. Most of time the secret is learning to design graphs, not its algorithm, since a large set of them have been well developed. Thus I created this repository for in-depth learning of some of its well-known problems, including polynomial-time and hard ones. At the end, I hope I can gain and make good use of them.
